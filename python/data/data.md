# RMMA Framework

## RMMA Framework
Resource Monitoring and Management Application (RMMA) is a framework that GFIS Innovative Solutions conceptualized to describe designing, developing and deploying systems for resource monitoring. The definition of resource is broad and unlimited. It allows monitoring tangible and intangible information as long as they are quantifiable and measurable. Resource can be data stored in database servers, manpower or human resource, assets, vehicles, state, for example measurement of heat level, and these days even emotion and opinions.

## RMMA Conception
The conception of RMMA came from 3 projects that GFIS Innovative Solutions developed for MERS999 CAD system. They are BalaiMon, PrinterMon and CADSA. Balai monitoring system or BalaiMon is a system used to monitor firetrucks (LRT/FRT) status and availability at all JBPM (Jabatan Bomba dan Penyelamat Malaysia) Balai Bomba (Fire Stations) nationwide. It reads the firetrucks information from MERS 999 Computer Aided Dispatch system, and display its information in a dashboard. Printer monitoring system or PrinterMon is a system to monitor printers at all Balai Bomba JBPM nationwide. Printing is a part of JBPM day to day work operation – printing reports of emergency calls details. It reads local USB printer information and status, and updates the information to a dashboard. It uses a console application called PrinterMon console app which is installed and run at the balai workstation. CAD Synchronizer Application or CADSA is a monitoring and managing app for Agencies (at RC) and PSCCs (at STC) connectivity status for the MERS 999 Computer Aided Dispatch system. CADSA is developed to overcome the issue of the different DB version of CAD deployed servers. It taps the system database directly and change the status value to ensure data synchronicity in the system.  

## Key Features of RMMA Framework 
RMMA Framework offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to enhance resource monitoring and management process. The overall objective is to offer a Comprehensive Resource Monitoring Toolkit. 6 key features that underlies RMMA Framework:
- Scalability and Flexibility
- Monitoring and Alert
- Operability
- Dynamic Customizable Dashboard
- Intelligent Analytics for Data-driven Decisions
- Seamless Integration with Third-Party Tools

## Challenges RMMA Framework is solving
RMMA Framework aims to solve the following problems:
- IT Sector
    * Developing software or application following good development practice 
    * Ensuring uptime and system reliability by eliminating/ minimising frequent software updates, hardware failures, and network bottlenecks
- Agriculture Sector
    * Monitoring variables like soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop health to increase crop yields, and reducing resource wastage, and financial losses.
- Service Sector
    * Workflow automation and workforce optimization ensure resource readiness and service efficiency which in turn leads to customer satisfaction
- Health Sector
    * Patient care depends on the readiness and availability of medical resources and inaccurate monitoring can lead to treatment delays and impact patient outcomes.
- Telemetry Sector
    * Telemetry systems depend on accurate and real-time data collection from remote locations. Inadequate resource monitoring can lead to data gaps, compromising decision-making and operational efficiency.
- CCTV and GPS Tracking
    * In the surveillance industry, gaps in monitoring can leave security vulnerabilities unaddressed, potentially leading to security breaches and property damage.

# Resource Management & Monitoring Application Push-to-Alert System (RMMA PTA System)

## What is RMMA PTA or RMMA Push-to-Alert System? 
RMMA Push-to-Alert system (RMMA PTA) is a revolutionary solution designed to enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of medical personnels in health facility such as Klinik Kesihatan (clinic) during critical situations, especially during after hours. Often called as the PTA system, it empowers medical facilities in Malaysia to promptly address emergency request by providing instant alerts directly to personnel mobile phones. The emergency request is triggered via PTA internet of things devices or PTA IoT devices placed strategically and conveniently at medical facilities entrance. 

## RMMA PTA Creator and Developer
The PTA system is developed by GFIS Innovative Solutions.

## Public Medical Facilities in Malaysia 
Malaysia uses a two-tiered healthcare system in which the government-run healthcare sector co-exists with a private healthcare system. Government medical facilities are managed by Health Ministry (Kementerian Kesihatan) which include hospitals, clinics (Klinik Kesihatan), dental clinics (Klinik Pergigian) and rural clinics (Klinik Desa). Public healthcare is paid by Malaysian citizens through general taxation of income. This public universal healthcare is accessible to all legal residents of Malaysia, funded by the government, to provide low-cost universal and comprehensive services.

## PTA System Users in Clinics
The PTA system is used in clinics (Klinik Kesihatan) by the assistant medical officers, nurses and administrative staff. They are responsible for responding to PTA alerts and attending patients including for emergency cases, maternity cases and medical appointments.

## PTA System Users in District Health Office 
In the District Health Office (Pusat Kesihatan Daerah), the administrative officers use PTA system to monitor all alerts and appoinments data in all the clinics under its jurisdiction.

## Components of PTA System 
PTA system encompasses of PTA IoT Device, PTA Mobile applicaton and PTA Web-based application. Future expansion will include PTA Smart Device, a touch screen smart interface that has all the functionality of PTA IoT Device with additional interactive functions.

## PTA IoT Device
The PTA IoT device is a rectangular high durability and visibility device that houses push buttons with light indicators. The public can trigger immediate medical attention from medical personnel in the vicinity by pushing the button. Its design and form allow easy usage. PTA IoT devices are placed at strategic and convenient locations around clinic entrance. PTA IoT devices cater for emergency cases, maternity or ob-gyn services, and scheduled appointment.

## PTA Mobile application
The PTA mobile application is an Android and IoS mobile application for medical personnel to help them receive alert and notification for medical attention. It allows medical personnel to identfy the type of medical attention request such as emeregency cases, maternity cases or a scheduled appointment. It notifies the user with alert sound, and incorporates the process of receiving, acknowledging, and attending the case systematically. This helps to enhance key performance indicators (KPIs) for alert time-to-respond of medical personnel.

## PTA Web-based Application
The PTA system accompanying web-based application is a comprehensive administrative tool designed to elevate emergency response management and monitoring. The web-based application was developed with excellent UI/UX components to provide both administrative and medical staffs with valuable insights into alert records, facilitating real-time monitoring and analysis for continuous improvement.

## PTA Web-based Application Modules
The PTA web-based application has different modules for clinic staff (staf Klinik Kesihatan), appointment staff, district health office officers (PKD admin) and SuperAdmin who are GFIS Innovative Solution system administrators. 

## RMMA PTA Deployment Location
The first deployment of PTA system is at 7 clinics (Klinik Kesihatan) under Hulu Langat District Health Office (Pusat Kesihatan Daerah Hulu Langat). The seven clinics are Bandar Baru Bangi clinic, Beranang clinic, Batu 14 clinic, Sungai Chua clinic, Batu 9 clinic, Kajang clinic and Bandar Seri Putra clinic. Each clinic is provided with one PTA IoT device, two mobile phones with PTA mobile app, monthly mobile internet subscription and access to PTA web-based application.
