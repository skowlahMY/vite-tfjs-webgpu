    "title": "RMMA Framework",
    "text": " Resource Monitoring and Management Application (RMMA) is a framework that GFIS Innovative Solutions conceptualized to describe designing, developing and deploying systems for resource monitoring. The definition of resource is broad and unlimited. It allows monitoring tangible and intangible information as long as they are quantifiable and measurable. Resource can be data stored in database servers, manpower or human resource, assets, vehicles, state, for example measurement of heat level, and these days even emotion and opinions."

    "title": "RMMA Conception",
    "text": " The conception of RMMA came from 3 projects that GFIS Innovative Solutions developed for MERS999 CAD system. They are BalaiMon, PrinterMon and CADSA. Balai monitoring system or BalaiMon is a system used to monitor firetrucks (LRT/FRT) status and availability at all JBPM (Jabatan Bomba dan Penyelamat Malaysia) Balai Bomba (Fire Stations) nationwide. It reads the firetrucks information from MERS 999 Computer Aided Dispatch system, and display its information in a dashboard. Printer monitoring system or PrinterMon is a system to monitor printers at all Balai Bomba JBPM nationwide. Printing is a part of JBPM day to day work operation – printing reports of emergency calls details. It reads local USB printer information and status, and updates the information to a dashboard. It uses a console application called PrinterMon console app which is installed and run at the balai workstation. CAD Synchronizer Application or CADSA is a monitoring and managing app for Agencies (at RC) and PSCCs (at STC) connectivity status for the MERS 999 Computer Aided Dispatch system. CADSA is developed to overcome the issue of the different DB version of CAD deployed servers. It taps the system database directly and change the status value to ensure data synchronicity in the system."
